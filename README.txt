Write a script in “R” to connect to a “End of Sprint Survey” originally created in google forms.

Sprint 2 - (Using Bayesian Statistical Theory): As a Technology Teacher I need to get exposed to Google Forms and Google Sheets and create a Survey with Google Forms instead of SurveyMonkey (as there are limitations without a paid subscriptionn so that I am able to read the Google Form Survey data in R, and to understand a basic R script. 

Project Description: To create an "End of Sprint Survey" in Google Forms, generate mock data, then take the responses and create a Google Sheet from it, and then read the survey results in R. Then create a script in R to automate (simplify) the process of reading/viewing it in R. 

Created a "End of Sprint Survey" in Google Forms. Documented potential participant and survey designer biases which may come into play when creating and filling out an End-of-Course Survey. Generated mock data by filling out the "End of Sprint Survey" in Google Forms multiple times.  Analysed the responses of the End of Sprint Survey data and created a Google Sheet from the results.

Set the proper working directory in R, installed and loaded the googlesheet library and entered the necessary commands to be able to read the Google Sheet (End of Sprint Survey data) into R. Then simplied the R process by writing a script for reading/viewing the Google Sheet data in R.
